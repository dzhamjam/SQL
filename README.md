Hello! This repository is about how I studied SQL at my university while doing lab work. During the work, I used technologies such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

Data base:

![АхмедовДМ_Кс-33_Вариант_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47e14597-ae56-42cc-a2cf-ebee25e1e4f6)

Scheme:

![АхмедовДМ_Кс-33_Схема](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/868aff23-adb4-49ce-ac94-23c2c7b67b82)

The request: the output includes the buyer's last name and a total based on how many apartments they purchased..
